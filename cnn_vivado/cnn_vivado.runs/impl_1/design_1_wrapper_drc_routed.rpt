AVAL-318#1 Warning
DSP_dynamic_PCIN_tieoff_only_on_bottom_sites  
The DSP48E2 design_1_i/Conv_0/inst/fadd_32ns_32ns_32_4_full_dsp_1_U14/Conv_fadd_32ns_32ns_32_4_full_dsp_1_ip_u/inst/i_synth/ADDSUB_OP.ADDSUB/DSP.OP/DSP48E1_BODY.ALIGN_ADD/DSP2/i_no_versal_es1_workaround.DSP is not placed on a bottom site of the device, has OPMODE[5:4] driven by active nets (value '01' uses PCIN bus), and ties some or all of its PCIN bus pin(s) to GND, but that connectivity is only available for the bottom DSP site. Care should be taken for the effect on that PCIN if the DSP site below it is used.
